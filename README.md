### NAME

PALACE – A Isai Gordeev note-taking storage

### SYNOPSIS

The PALACE is a structured digital vault for notes, ideas, and
project management. It supports time-linked notes, Zettelkasten
methodology, and hierarchical organization.

### DESCRIPTION

PALACE is a personal storage system for taking, linking, and
managing notes. Notes are structured with timestamps, tags, and
unique links for efficient navigation and evolution tracking.

### MOTIVATION

To write and structure thoughts, ideas, and projects efficiently.

### PHILOSOPHY

Notes are organized into four main domains:

- Resources
- Projects
- Management
- Instances

Core links denote the meaning of most notes and are placed in
corresponding folders.

### PRINCIPLES

1. Autonomous principle Each note must be clear and independent.
   Enables future linkage.
2. Graph principle Each note should link to at least one other note.
   Ensures a connected network.
3. Occam's razor principle Notes are kept simple while complete.
4. Deletion principle Notes are not deleted but can be updated with
   new notes or revisions.
5. Simple principle Notes are primarily textual for minimalistic
   consistency.
6. Absorbing principle Each note should be written and copied if the
   idea is understood.

### NOTE STRUCTURE

- Title: {{date:ddd DD MMM YYYY}} at {{time:HH:mm:ss}}
- Content: main body of the note
- Tags: used to navigate topics and problems (e.g., ###return,
  ###research)
- Zettelkasten notes: for quick, time-linked thoughts, optionally
  linked to daily notes

### USAGE

- Notes can be nested or listed, each with a unique link.
- Weekly notes contain past reflections and next-week plans.
- The vault directory contains only folders and [[PALACE]].
- If a relevant folder does not exist, create one and link
  appropriately.

### ZETTELKASTEN METHOD

- Quick note capture system.
- Notes are independent by default but can be linked to daily notes.
- Time-stamped notes example: "2022 19 July 23.23 – Tretyakov
  gallery"
