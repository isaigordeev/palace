- **Notes** can be listed, or even nested-listed, but each
  **question**, **item** **point** must have its **unique link**!
  (_inconvenient for outlines_)
- **Date** + **time** can divide a note for updating ^6db043
- Weekly notes contain plans for the next week and thoughts of the
  past ^0caf0d
- [[PALACE]] can't be linked by any other notes (\*except
  fundamental like [[START PAGE]]) ^07198f
- In **vault** directory must only be nothing except folders and
  [[PALACE]]. Other note are arranged into their special
  [[PALACE#Folders|folders]]. If there is no relevant
  [[PALACE#Folders|folder]] create and [[PALACE#^b7328e|#lige]] a
  new relevant one.
- 2 levels of note security (diffused cloud – notes folder) and
  (stored locally – sensible folder)

#### Note structure

##### Title

{{date:ddd DD MMM}} {{date:YYYY}} at {{time:HH:mm:ss}} or Sun 08 Oct
2023 at 17:07:55

##### Content

content

#### Tags

Tags are used to **navigate** some idea or work. I came to
convenient use of tags, specifying each tag by name of problem and
nesting them.

For example \#return/article_on_neuroscience – very simple,
efficient, and useful

May use them in a little chaotic way..

But there are anyway some **stable** tags, which are always
relevant: ^9c4016

##### Tags list //to review

#return #research

#### Zettelkasten notes

Zettel is very much convenient for notes with the
[[PALACE#^118968|time linkage]] and for
[[PALACE#^d2004a|notes with postfix]].

Zettelkasten taking note is needed for an instant thougth. By
default, it is not connected no any other note. If needed, it can be
connected to **daily note**.

Also Zettelkasten note has its
**[[New zettelkasten note|unique title]]**.

##### Zettelkasten time notes

For instance some walks note: ^118968
